This is a very simple RESTful API made using javascript, mongodb and mongoose. If you are facing any problems with this api you can make an issue on github.

# How to get started with the api:

****you need to have node js, mongodb and git installed****

git clone the project:
```
git clone https://github.com/iron-coder12/wiki-api.git
```

Install all the dependencies:

```
node install

```

Now all the dependencies are installed the next step is to get the mongo db server running.

open a new terminal window (or if you are using hyper terminal ****hyper.is**** you can open a new tab) and enter this commman:

```
mongod
```
